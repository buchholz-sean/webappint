# Introduction

### Thanks for checking out Bullets!

First off, thank you for considering contributing to Bullets. None of us is as smart as all of us, after all.


### Guidelines

Following these guidelines helps to communicate that you respect the time of the developers managing and developing this open source project. In return, they should reciprocate that respect in addressing your issue, assessing changes, and helping you finalize your pull requests.

### Types of Contributions.

We're looking for all kinds of contributions. Bug reports, feature requests, documentation improvements, and even code additions or improvements will all be considered for implementation. The only specific contribution request we have is that you don't use the Issues tracker for support questions.

# Ground Rules
### Responsibilities

* Create issues for any major changes and enhancements that you wish to make. Discuss things transparently and get community feedback.
* Keep feature versions as small as possible, preferably one new feature per version.
* Be welcoming to newcomers and encourage diverse new contributors from all backgrounds.

# Your First Contribution

Not sure where or how to start? Take a look through the [Issues tracker](https://github.com/seanbuchholz/webappint/issues)

Working on your first Pull Request? You can learn how from this *free* series, [How to Contribute to an Open Source Project on GitHub](https://egghead.io/series/how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project-on-github).

If a maintainer asks you to "rebase" your PR, they're saying that a lot of code has changed, and that you need to update your branch so it's easier to merge.

# Getting started
### The process

1. Fork the code base (currently, fork from `master`--in the future contributors will fork from a `development` branch)
2. Create a new branch for your feature
3. Ensure that your code meets our [Style Guide](https://github.com/seanbuchholz/webappint/style-guide) requirements
4. When you're finished, submit a Pull Request to get feedback from the team and the community
5. Make any requested changes, and a maintainer will decide whether to merge your code in or close the PR

If your Pull Request doesn't get added to the code base, don't feel bad! We'll try and give you as much feedback as possible to ensure that even if we don't use your code, we aren't wasting your time.

### Small contributions

Small contributions such as fixing spelling errors, where the content is small enough to not be considered intellectual property, can be submitted by a contributor as a patch.

As a rule of thumb, changes are obvious fixes if they do not introduce any new functionality or creative thinking. As long as the change does not affect functionality, some likely examples include the following:
* Spelling / grammar fixes
* Typo correction, white space and formatting changes
* Comment clean up
* Bug fixes that change default return values or error codes stored in constants
* Adding logging messages or debugging output
* Changes to ‘metadata’ files like .gitignore, build scripts, etc.
* Moving source files from one directory or package to another

# How to report a bug

 If you find a security vulnerability, do NOT open an issue. Email sean.buchholz@me.com instead.

In order to determine whether you are dealing with a security issue, ask yourself these two questions:
* Can I access something that's not mine, or something I shouldn't have access to?
* Can I disable something for other people?

If the answer to either of those two questions is "yes", then you're probably dealing with a security issue. Note that even if you answer "no" to both questions, you may still be dealing with a security issue, so if you're unsure, just email me at sean.buchholz@me.com.

### What goes into a bug report

When filing an issue, make sure to answer these five questions:

1. What version of Bullets are you using?
2. What did you do?
3. What did you expect to see?
4. What did you see instead?

# How to suggest a feature or enhancement

If you find yourself wishing for a feature that doesn't exist in Bullets, you are probably not alone. Open an issue on our issues list on GitHub which describes the feature you would like to see, why you need it, and how it should work. Remember, though, that the core philosophy of Bullets is that less is more! If a feature seems like it would add unnecessary complexity, we may ask if there's a way to fulfill that need in a simpler way.

# Code review process

Since this is, at the time of writing, still a small project, I or another maintainer will be looking at PRs as they come through. We'll give feedback to a PR within a week of it being opened. After feedback has been given we expect responses within two weeks. After two weeks we may close the pull request if it isn't showing any activity.

<!-- # Community
If there are other channels you use besides GitHub to discuss contributions, mention them here. You can also list the author, maintainers, and/or contributors here, or set expectations for response time.

> You can chat with the core team on https://gitter.im/cucumber/cucumber. We try to have office hours on Fridays.
